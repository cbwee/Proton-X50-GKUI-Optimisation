# Proton-X50-GKUI-Optimisation
Optimisation script to disable system apps for Proton X50 IHU on GKUI 19 (Neusoft E01).

* Modified from the [optimisation script](https://github.com/xeon1989/Proton-X50-APK-Installer-ATLAS/files/11863895/GKUIOptimizationScript.zip) found in https://github.com/xeon1989/Proton-X50-APK-Installer-ATLAS/issues/37, it only works on Proton X50 2020 - 2023 with Neusoft E01 IHU running GKUI 19, tested on firmware version `SW0SXRA1201H5064.00379`.

* When it is used, keep the car power on until IHU reboots and finishes starting.
